# Colors Matcher

A simple web tool that helps you find the closest named colors from CSS and Material Design palettes for any color input.

## Project Origin
The project was born from a need to bring more order to the colors I use in my work. As a web developer, I used to pick colors for my prototypes quite chaotically. Over time, I noticed that I really like the shades from the Material Design color palette, and I often tried to find the closest matches to the colors I had originally chosen. Sometimes I also look for named CSS colors, because they’re easy to remember and to write directly in CSS. This tool is designed exactly for that purpose — it helps me find those closest matches so the colors in my projects are more consistent.
